AP	Kevin Todd	Livingstone-Macleod	<div ><div ><h3></h3><p>Meet Kevin:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Todd was born and raised in the community of Nanton and has had the privilege of raising his own family in the same town.</span></p><p><img style="float: right; max-width: 350px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -20px;" src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3231/attachments/original/1683102411/Kevin_Todd_New_Website.jpg?1683102411" alt="None" width="500" height="571"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his family has grown in this rural community, so has his commitment and service to the town and surrounding areas. Kevin has always been an active member of the community, whether it be volunteering with the Nanton Futures Foundation, Nanton Promoters, or the Nanton Golf Club. He also holds previous municipal political experience, having served on the Town Council for multiple years. Sharing his deep sense of neighbourhood involvement, Kevin's wife and both of his daughters are also an active part of the Nanton community.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting at the age of 12, Kevin travelled throughout Southern Alberta as both a hockey player and referee. He continues to travel through the riding as an avid outdoorsman and spends many weekends with his family camping, hunting, fishing, and quadding in the big, beautiful backyard that is the Rocky Mountains.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin’s background in finance and his keen entrepreneurial spirit are what keeps him visiting all parts of the province and beyond as part of his work life. He never misses an opportunity to learn something new from a stranger, hop in his truck and drive a couple of hours for a cup of coffee, or have a chat about the importance of getting outdoors and getting back to nature.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as he enjoys collaborating with people from all walks of life and exploring the small-town gems Alberta has to offer, Kevin always finds himself drawn back to Nanton. To him, southern Alberta is the heart of the province, and it holds a special place for both himself and his family.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Visit us on Social Media</strong></p><table style="width: 16.2905%; border-collapse: collapse;" border="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 151px;"><td style="width: 84.2917%; height: 151px;"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3231/attachments/original/1683101734/FB_02.png?1683101734" alt="" width="130" height="130"></td><td style="width: 473.835%; height: 151px;"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3231/attachments/original/1683101734/Twitter__01.png?1683101734" alt="" width="130" height="130"></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></div><!--Content Row End--><!--CA Event--><!--CA Blog--><!--Contact Section--><div ><h3></h3><p>Contact Us</p><p>If you'd like to help us get Kevin elected MLA for the Livingstone-Macleod constituency, please contact us:<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2a6bdb6b6e0e2e0e192b3beb0b7a0a6b3a2b3a0a6abfcb1b3"><span  data-cfemail="d8acb7bcbceae8eaeb98b9b4babdaaacb9a8b9aaaca1f6bbb9">[emailprotected]</span></a></p><p></p></div><!--Contact Section End--><!--End Page Call to Action--><div ><div ></div><div ><div ><a href="/donate_to_kevin%0A"><div ><i ></i><h4>Donate to Kevin </h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="/kevin_todd_lawn_signs"><div ><i ></i><h4>Request a Lawn Sign</h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="volunteer_for_kevin"><div ><i ></i><h4>Volunteer for Kevin</h4></div></a></div></div></div></div>
AP	Myles Chykerda	Lacombe-Ponoka	<div ><div ><h3></h3><p>Meet Myles:</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myles Chykerda is a 4th generation rural Albertan born and raised in Stettler and Lacombe. He is part of a family with deep roots in farming, teaching, and the oil and gas industry. Family and community are central aspects of what the Chykerda clan believes in, and Myles has a long</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">history of community engagement and accepting leadership roles in non-profit societies.</span></p><p><img style="float: right; max-width: 350px; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -20px;" src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3218/attachments/original/1682995605/Myles_Chykerda_Full_02.jpg?1682995605" alt="" width="1328" height="4459"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Myles has not lived solely in rural areas and has spent time in Athens, Greece and Los</span>Angeles. Living abroad allowed him to experience different cultures, but has always increased his appreciation for what we have in Alberta. While attending University of Alberta, he was an early adopter of downtown living, moving into a condo in the heart of Edmonton’s financial district in 2004.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Edmonton he met and became friends with numerous people that had been left behind by the boom. Individuals living on the street had been largely forgotten and left without anywhere to go for help or any aid to help them succeed. The idea of a hand-UP as opposed to a hand-out is something that strongly resonates with Myles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myles believes in a balanced society supported by an efficient government. The economy and ensuring Albertans have access to quality jobs is vital, and health care and education are paramount, but non-profits and fine arts groups are equally important in the creation of a rich Alberta that can be enjoyed by all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myles is a professional archaeologist with Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees from UofA and a soon-to-be-completed Ph.D. from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). He has worked on projects in Alberta, Italy, and Greece, and focuses on understanding how complex societies form through an interaction of natural landscapes, urban development, and social memory. He also dabbles in museum exhibit design and had his work showcased early this year in the Diachonic Museum of Larissa, Greece.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching is also a passion for Myles. While at UCLA, he instructed various courses ranging from Greek Archaeology to World Mythology. A core</span></p><p>component of all these classes was ensuring students learned to think critically and analyze the world around them. He also participated regularly in outreach activities that brought archaeological artifacts and a passion for history and the ancient world to inner-city schools.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All his experiences have led Myles to believe in governance via open and transparent processes rooted in facts and logic. As the former Alberta Party candidate for Lacombe-Ponoka, he championed issues that matter to the area, including pragmatic solutions to rural crime, sustainable improvements to the region’s healthcare system, and building an efficient Government of Alberta that offers needed support to all Albertans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the 2019 election, Myles joined the Alberta Party's Provincial Board, where he serves as Corporate Secretary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given his passion for learning, Myles is also proud to serve as the Alberta Party's Shadow Minister for Advanced Education.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can explore Myles' research interests at</span><a href="https://ucla.academia.edu/MylesChykerda"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Academia.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Visit us on Social Media</strong></p><table style="width: 16.2905%; border-collapse: collapse;" border="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 151px;"><td style="width: 84.2917%; height: 151px;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/myleschykerda"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3218/attachments/original/1682979370/FB_02.png?1682979370" alt="" width="130" height="130"></a></td><td style="width: 473.835%; height: 151px;"><a href="https://twitter.com/mchykerda"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3218/attachments/original/1682979370/Twitter__01.png?1682979370" alt="" width="130" height="130"></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></div><!--Content Row End--><!--CA Event--><!--CA Blog--><!--Contact Section--><div ><h3></h3><p>Contact Us</p><p>If you'd like to help us get Myles elected MLA for the Lacombe-Ponoka constituency, please contact us:<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f5969d8c9e90879194c7c5c7c6b594999790878194859487818cdb9694"><span  data-cfemail="fe9d9687959b8c9a9fcccecccdbe9f929c9b8c8a9f8e9f8c8a87d09d9f">[emailprotected]</span></a></p><p></p></div><!--Contact Section End--><!--End Page Call to Action--><div ><div ></div><div ><div ><a href="/donate_to_myles%0A"><div ><i ></i><h4>Donate to Myles </h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="/myles_chykerda_lawn_sign"><div ><i ></i><h4>Request a Sign</h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="volunteer_for_myles"><div ><i ></i><h4>Volunteer for Myles</h4></div></a></div></div></div></div>

Eager for another challenge, she took her experience to municipal politics. Elected to the Town of Mayerthorpe Council in 2017, she became the Mayor in March of 2019 and holds</span><span>that position today.</span></p><p><span>“I cut my governance teeth sitting on Co-op and not-for-profit Boards,” said Jabush. “After joining Town Council, I got involved with Alberta Municipalities where I served on the Board of Directors and committees that dealt with everything from municipal governance to my current assignment on the Economic Strategies Committee. I’m also honoured to represent the association on the Safety Codes Council Board of Directors.”</span></p><p><span>Jabush is eager to bring her municipal government experience to the Alberta Legislature.</span></p><p><span>Like most Albertans, she recognizes that change is needed in healthcare, education and inter-governmental relationships. </span></p><p><span>“Albertans need to know there’s a doctor or a nurse in the ER when they get there, they need access to family doctors and they need to know that when they dial 911, they won’t wait for an ambulance to arrive,” says Jabush. “And our schools need better funding. When I read that Alberta ranks dead last in per-pupil spending, I was angry! I have grandkids in the system. They deserve better.”</span></p><p>Ever the optimist, Jabush believes that better relationships with our municipal and federal counterparts are not only possible but necessary. “We need to work together for all Albertans,’ said Jabush. “We have promises to keep!”</p><p><span>Janet’s been married to Darrel for almost 43 years. They have three amazing kids, eight grandkids and one great-grandson. In her busy life, spare time is rare and almost always spent with family. Her family is her “why”. </span></p><p><span>Alberta winters are spent reading, baking and movie-watching. As soon as the weather permits, Janet and Darrel are on their motorcycles. From Jasper to Cold Lake to Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park and La Crete, Janet’s passion for two-wheel adventure has taken her across the province she loves.</span></p><p><strong>Visit us on Social Media</strong></p><table style="width: 16.2905%; border-collapse: collapse;" border="0"><tbody><tr style="height: 151px;"><td style="width: 84.2917%; height: 151px;"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3213/attachments/original/1682946664/FB_02.png?1682946664" alt="" width="130" height="130"></td><td style="width: 473.835%; height: 151px;"><img src="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/abparty/pages/3213/attachments/original/1682946662/Twitter__01.png?1682946662" alt="" width="130" height="130"></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></div><!--Content Row End--><!--CA Event--><!--CA Blog--><!--Contact Section--><div ><h3></h3><p>Contact Us</p><p>If you'd like to help us get Janet elected MLA for the Sherwood Park constituency, please contact us:<br><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a303b382f2932686a68691a3b36383f282e3b2a3b282e2374393b"><span  data-cfemail="6802090a1d1b005a585a5b2809040a0d1a1c0918091a1c11460b09">[emailprotected]</span></a></p><p></p></div><!--Contact Section End--><!--End Page Call to Action--><div ><div ></div><div ><div ><a href="/donate_to_janet%0A"><div ><i ></i><h4>Donate to Janet </h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="/janet_jabush_news"><div ><i ></i><h4>Campaign News</h4></div></a></div><div ><a href="volunteer_for_janet"><div ><i ></i><h4>Volunteer for Janet</h4></div></a></div></div></div></div>
