GPA	Joel Hunt	Taber-Warner	Joel Hunt is a resident of Bow Island, Alberta, where he moved after growing up in the Fraser Valley in BC. He received a diploma in Building Engineering Technology from the BC Institute of Technology, and has spent 30 years in construction, architecture, and engineering fields, having built everything from houses to government to agricultural buildings. Joel recently became a LEED Green Associate because of his concern about the effect of the construction industry on our environment.
